Certainly, adding a description of your personal portfolio built using React.js on your resume is a great idea. It showcases your skills, creativity, and technical abilities. Here's a sample description you could use as a starting point:

"Personal Portfolio (Built with React.js):
I designed and developed a dynamic personal portfolio website using React.js, highlighting my skills, projects, and accomplishments. Leveraging modern web development practices, I created an interactive and responsive user interface that seamlessly adapts to various devices and screen sizes. Through the use of React components, state management, and routing, I ensured smooth navigation and an engaging user experience. The portfolio features a clean and modern design, showcasing my technical expertise and creativity. By integrating various third-party libraries and optimizing performance, I successfully demonstrated my ability to deliver fast and visually appealing web applications. The project not only serves as a showcase of my work but also reflects my passion for staying up-to-date with the latest trends in front-end development."

Feel free to customize and expand upon this description based on your actual achievements and the unique aspects of your portfolio. Make sure to emphasize any notable features, technologies, or challenges you encountered during the development process.
